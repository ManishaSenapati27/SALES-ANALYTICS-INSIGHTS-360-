# SALES-ANALYTICS-INSIGHTS-360-

I am happy to share my latest project as a data analyst at Atiq Mart!

🛒 Atliq Mart, a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets, recently ran massive promotions during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 on their Atiq branded products. As the sales director wanted immediate insights into the success of these promotions, I took charge of analyzing the data and presenting key findings.

🔍 Leveraging SQL and PowerBI, I dove into the data provided by our stakeholders to uncover which promotions performed well and which ones didn't. To streamline the analysis process and avoid repeating code, I created a view in SQL called "sales summary," which provided a consolidated overview of sales data.

📈 Through my PowerBI dashboard, I walked through the tasks undertaken and the compelling findings discovered.
